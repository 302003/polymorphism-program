Develop a C# program to create a class named shape. Create three sub classes namely: circle, triangle and  square, each class has two member functions named draw () and erase (). Demonstrate polymorphism  concepts by developing suitable methods, defining member data and main program.



using System;

// Base class Shape
class Shape
{
    // Method to draw a shape
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape");
    }

    // Method to erase a shape
    public virtual void Erase()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Erasing a shape");
    }
}

// Derived class Circle
class Circle : Shape
{
    // Method to draw a circle
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
    }

    // Method to erase a circle
    public override void Erase()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Erasing a circle");
    }
}

// Derived class Triangle
class Triangle : Shape
{
    // Method to draw a triangle
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a triangle");
    }

    // Method to erase a triangle
    public override void Erase()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Erasing a triangle");
    }
}

// Derived class Square
class Square : Shape
{
    // Method to draw a square
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a square");
    }

    // Method to erase a square
    public override void Erase()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Erasing a square");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Creating objects of different shapes
        Shape[] shapes = new Shape[3];
        shapes[0] = new Circle();
        shapes[1] = new Triangle();
        shapes[2] = new Square();

        // Demonstrate polymorphism by calling Draw and Erase methods
        foreach (Shape shape in shapes)
        {
            shape.Draw();
            shape.Erase();
            Console.WriteLine(); // Adding a newline for separation
        }
    }
}



Output:

Drawing a circle
Erasing a circle

Drawing a triangle
Erasing a triangle

Drawing a square
Erasing a square
